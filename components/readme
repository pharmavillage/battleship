# Introduction

This is a area where the components are stored that will be used within other folders through yarn workspaces 



# Usage


To create a component, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the root directory of the monorepo.
2. Run the following command:

```bash
slipway
```

(Note: This command focuses on the code behind the components used within the app. The Storybook implementation is located elsewhere.)
