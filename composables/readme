## Introduction

The Composable Folder system is designed to help developers manage their codebase by breaking it down into reusable and modular components. This approach enhances maintainability, readability, and scalability of the code. Each module or component can be independently developed, tested, and deployed.

### Explanation

- **components/**: Contains all the reusable UI components.
- **utils/**: Contains utility functions and helpers.
- **services/**: Contains service files for API calls and business logic.
- **hooks/**: Contains custom hooks for React.
- **contexts/**: Contains context providers for React Context API.
- **pages/**: Contains page components or views.
- **App.js**: The root component of the application.
- **index.js**: The entry point of the application.
- **package.json**: The metadata file for npm, including dependencies and scripts.

## Best Practices

- **Consistency**: Follow consistent naming conventions and file structure.
- **Modularity**: Keep components and modules small and focused on a single responsibility.
- **Reusability**: Design components and utilities to be reusable across the application.
- **Documentation**: Document your code and modules for better maintainability.
- **Testing**: Write tests for your components, utilities, and services to ensure reliability.
